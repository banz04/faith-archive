# The Glorious Mysteries
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

### 1. Apostles' Creed
I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of
the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended into hell. On the third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at
the right hand of God, the Father almighty. From there He will come to judge the living and the
dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the
forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

### 2. Our Father
Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil. Amen.

### 3. Three Hail Marys
For an increase in the virtues of **Faith**, **Hope**, and **Charity**:

Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

### 4. Glory Be
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

# Closing Prayers
### Hail Holy Queen
Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our Life, our Sweetness, and our hope. To thee we cry, poor
banished children of Eve. To thee we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of
tears. Turn then most gracious advocate, Thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile,
show unto us, the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray
for us O Holy Mother of God, That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

### Final Prayer
Let us pray. O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for
us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the
Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what
they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

<br>
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
